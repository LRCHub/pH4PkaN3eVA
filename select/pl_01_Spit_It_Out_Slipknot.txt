Since you never gave a damn
in the first place
Maybe it's time you had
the tables turned
Cuz in the interest
of all involved
I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty
MAN NEARLY KILLED ME
Steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll
you were DEAD FROM THE GIT GO
BIG MOUTH FUCKER
STUPID COCKSUCKER
Are you scared of me now
Then you're dumber than I
thought Always is, never was
Foundation made
of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya
Think I fear ya BULLSHIT
Just another dumb punk
chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to
break through the noise
Was it something that
I said that got you bent
It's gotta be that
way if you want it
Sanity, Literal Profanity HIT ME
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Maybe it's the way you
spread a lotta rumour fodder
Keepin' all your little spies
and leavin' when you realise
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury
your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch
I didn't stutter
If you know what's good sit
shut up and beg, brother
Backstab Don't you know
who you're dissin'
Side swipe
we know THE ASS THAT
YOU'RE KISSIN'
BIGIDY-BIGGIDY BITCH BOY
HALFWAY HAUSER
Can't hear shit
cuz I keep gettin' louder
Step up, and you get a
face full o' tactic
Lippin' off hard
goin' home in a basket
You got no pull
no power, no NUTHIN'
Now you start shit Well
ain't that somethin'
Payoffs don't protect
and you can't hide if you want
But I'LL FIND YOU
Comin' up behind you
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
<♪>
'Bout time I set this
record straight
All the needlenose
punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin'
on deaf ears
Where YOU gonna be in the
next five years
The crew and all the fools
and all the politix
Get your lips ready
gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got DICK when they
passed out the good stuff
Bam
Are you sick of me
GOOD ENOUGH HAD ENOUGH
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemies
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemas
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemies
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemas
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemies
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemas
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemas
FUCK ME I'm all out of enemas
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
SPIT IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
