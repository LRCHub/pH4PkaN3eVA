Back then my life was empty
Most things around disturbed me
Messed-up and really restless
My head was filled with distless
Until the day you saved me
You made me see things clearly
Nothing is ever hopeless
Got to know how to love myself

You made me love you, me and life

(Chorus:) Go ahead, spit it out, go ahead,
Go ahead, spit it out
That I am stupid
Go ahead, spit it out, go ahead,
Go ahead, spit it out
That I was mistaken
Go ahead, spit it out, go ahead,
Go ahead, spit it out
That I missed my chances
Go ahead, spit it out, go ahead,
Go ahead, spit it out
That I cannot fix it

Right now I grab my head and
Look back at what I have done
I've been a total fool
Can find no explanation
One day I could not take it
Guess things were just too perfect
So I took my stuff and left you
Though I will always love you

Thought you saved me I still left you
(Chorus)
