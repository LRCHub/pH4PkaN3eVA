Just can't seem to shine the light, deep inside your mind
Keep me waiting every night, waiting for a sign
Information on the low, nothing is revealed
Time goes by we don't even try so, baby what's the deal?

Oh, oh if there's something I should know
You should let your feelings show
If you want me tell me now,
Spit it out, spit it out

Searching for a sign life, shining like a curse
We don't argue, we don't fight only makes it worse
All emotions out the way behind that vacant stare
Nothing real is ever big tripping maybe you're just scared

Oh, oh if there's something I should know
You should let your feelings show
If you want me tell me now,
Spit it out, spit it out
If there's something on your mind
Why are you wasting all your time
If you want me tell me now,
Spit it out, spit it out

Spit it out
Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between

Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between

Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between

Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between

Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between

Time goes by numbers don't lie
Not one word turns into a shot
Speak Your mind say what you mean
I can't read the spaces between
