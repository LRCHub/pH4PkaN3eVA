I watch the wind
Sand covers my eyes again
Here I am, dazzled
I count the steps
Leading to the night
And it's bright

I wanna know
Won't you let me
I wanna know now
Come with me and enjoy this party
I wanna know will you let me
I wanna know now
Spit it out! I'll know it one day
I want to know it now baby
I want to konow it now

Don't ask me babe
How it is that I show no pain
Maybe I got my second chance
I don't look back
Staring at the sky
I don't cry

I wanna know
Won't you let me
I wanna know now
Come with me and enjoy this party
I wanna know will you let me
I wanna know now
Spit it out! I'll know it one day
I want to know it now baby
I want to konow it now

Getting to know you was never gonna getting better
I have to say it, I never thought you were so clever
I thought I had the world but all I had was never
Never getting good when we were together
Now I appreciate this time and this manner
Of living life as cool and as good as ever
